Haven anonymously connects users in a setting that promotes deeper, more serious, and introspective topics of conversation. Topics can range from accomplishments and failures, to struggles such as depression and relationship issues. Conversations that don’t typically take place over social media; topics that you might be uncomfortable discussing with even your friends and family. We aim to tackle the taboo conversations society fails to address.

Over the past few months of exploring people through conversation, I’ve realized one thing - everyone has a story. Talking to friends and strangers alike about Haven has really gotten me thinking; it shouldn’t have to take some sort of near death experience or emotional trauma to step back, take some time, and reflect meaningfully and learn more about ourselves. The reality is, we all have our own stories. We all have our struggles. We all have our secrets, our trials and our tribulations. So why is it that so many of us keep these aspects of our lives tucked away under the sheets?

Haven strives to spark the hard conversations. The conversations that we can all relate to, but no one wants to have. The conversations regarding purpose, pain, success, and suffering. The conversations that we believe enable people to understand themselves on a deeper level.
